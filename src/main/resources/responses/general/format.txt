Please format your code correctly. [Reddit itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_formatting_code)
supports code formatting by prepending every line of text with 4 spaces. You will get a lot more help if your code is readable.

In addition to that, if your code is more than a few lines it is better to post your code on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)
(single file) or as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). The latter has the benefit, besides supporting multiple files with
even different languages, that it can be easily cloned by someone who want to try and run your code locally.

To summarise: please format your code and preferably post it as a Gist if it's more than a few lines.
